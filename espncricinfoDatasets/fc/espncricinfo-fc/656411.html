another.

You could see a reckless shot was around the corner. Tamim opens the face to a length ball on off. Manages just an edge that Afsar Zazai takes diving to his left. He takes it one-handed, but in mid-air he gets it right hand around and nearly transfers it from left to right. The right hand has come around because the ball is slipping out. The right glove pushes it back into the left. This is top keeping. Afghanistan have taken their first World Cup wicket, and they have built dot by dot to it. Persistent accurate cricket from a team known to be mercurial and unpredictable.

The WC debutatnts began promisingly but Bangladesh were patient and waited for the inexperience to show. Mushfiqur and Shakib turned the game around with their fifties, and then the bowlers sealed the deal. That&#39;s all we have for you today. Thanks for joining us\n\n&quot;It&#39;s a great feeling,&quot; says &lt;b&gt;Mushfiqur Rahim&lt;/b&gt;, the Man of the Match. &quot;Credit also goes to openers. They didn&#39;t get the runs, but it is not that easy up front. They faced out important overs. Thanks to the crowd. My father is here, my uncle is here, it is a great moment.&quot;&quot;Definitely first match is important and we have set the tone,&quot; says &lt;b&gt;Mashrafe Mortaza&lt;/b&gt;. &quot;We had a reasonable start today.

Mushfiq and Shakib played very well and took the score to 260. We lost too manyb wickets early, but Nawroz and Sami batted well. Not a good start in the World Cup.

He takes it one-handed, but in mid-air he gets it right hand around and nearly transfers it from left to right. The right hand has come around because the ball is slipping out. The right glove pushes it back into the left. This is top keeping. Afghanistan have taken their first World Cup wicket, and they have built dot by dot to it.
