But at the halfway stage, after Australia powered their way to 290 in their fifty, we knew Pakistan would have to do something magical to overhaul that target. \n\nThat didn&#39;t happen with their batting as they lost regular wickets through their innings and neither did they look to even chase the 291 target. Pakistan batted out fifty overs and eventually succumbed to a 159-run loss. The tournament now goes mathematical for them. But that being said, they first need to win all of their remaining games to stay in contention. \n\nAustralia will be delighted they eventually manged to bowl Pakistan out. But they&#39;d be happier to see their batsmen doing well despite captain Meg Lanning&#39;s absence. It was a day of many individual performances, first from Villani, then from Perry, and then from Healy. But for what it&#39;s worth, Sana Mir&#39;s fighting 45 and three wickets will remain with me the longest. Australia move to the top of the table. \n\nThanks for staying with us through the day. Hope you enjoyed today&#39;s coverage. From Sreshth and Shashank, it&#39;s goodbye. \n\n\n&lt;strong&gt;5.15 pm&lt;/strong&gt; Pakistan captain &lt;strong&gt;Sana Mir:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Crucial catches were dropped when we were at the top. We missed some crucial catches, especially of players like Villani, they punished us. We were on the mark with the ball for atleast 25-30, but we need to bowl better at the death. Our batsmen need to step up, we can&#39;t rely on one batsman. This is why we are here. We need to build on our bowling and batting, our batters have the potential, it&#39;s just important they start clicking at the right time. I&#39;m pretty happy with our bowling but our fielding needs to improve.&quot;\n\nAustralia captain &lt;strong&gt;Rachael Haynes:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;I got a good partnership going but fell away but was good to see Villani and Perry play the way they did. Villani just came out and was so positive and once she gets going, very few grounds can contain her. She set the tone for the game. Looking forward to the next game against England.&quot;\n\n&lt;strong&gt;5.10 pm&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Elyse Villani&lt;/strong&gt; is the Player of the Match. She says: &quot;Cricket is a funny game (she was out for a duck last game), the girls showed they were rearing to go. Good to see Alyssa Healy get that innings towards the end and Pez (Perry) play some good shots. My job was to hit the ball and that&#39;s what I had to keep doing. It&#39;s just the way I should be playing.
