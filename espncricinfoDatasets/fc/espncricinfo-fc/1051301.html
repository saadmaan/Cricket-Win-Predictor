Important times coming up for Bangladesh with a tough series against England which begins in under a week&#39;s time. This match and the landmark win should certainly come as encouraging signs, but tougher tests await. Much to look forward to before that, of course. Pakistan and West Indies face off in the second ODI tomorrow, and of course, there is the Eden Gardens Test between India and New Zealand. Hope to catch you then. Cheers!\n\n&lt;b&gt;Mashrafe Mortaza&lt;/b&gt;: Hopefully, it (the leg) will be alright. At the moment, there is still a little bit of pain, but I expect it to be alright. Th way the team has been performing for the last one to one-and-a-half years has been delightful. Lot of important series coming up, hopefully the boys can keep it up. I think that&#39;&#39;s a sign of improvement. Once they get the chance, they come and perform. That&#39;s how the team improves, and I think that&#39;s how the team will go forward. They have been phenomenal for the last 8-10 years, they&#39;ve been performing superbly for the team. The way the seniors have been performing is what the team needs, hopefully, they can continue that. starting after 10 months was hard, but I think this game has come as a boost to the boys. We still have 10 days, hopefully we can work hard and come and perform well against England. \n\n&lt;b&gt;Tamim is also the Man of the Series&lt;/b&gt;\n\n&lt;b&gt;Tamim:&lt;/b&gt; Yes, it finally happened. I should have got it in the first game, I thought, but at the end of the day, I got it in the third ODI and I&#39;m happy. It wasn&#39;t the easiest wicket to bat on, I thought the ball was spinning a bit early on. The wicket was hard and dry. I took my time and finally got a hundred. Sabbir is an exciting player. That&#39;s (England series) a big one. The boys are all pumped up and hopefully we can have a good series.\n\n&lt;b&gt;Tamim Iqbal is the Man of the Match for his century&lt;/b&gt;\n\n&lt;b&gt;Asghar Stanikzai, Afghanistan captain:&lt;/b&gt; First of all, congratulations to the Bangladesh team. They played very well, especially Tamim, which is why they won the match. The first two games, we played according to the plan. Today, especially the bowlers didn&#39;t bowl according to the plan, which is why they made 280 runs on this wicket. Such a good experience against Bangladesh in Bangladesh. We will take all of that experience, and hopefully, we will come here the next time and do better. \n\nSo a thumping 141-run rout of Afghanistan for the 100th ODI win for Bangladesh. And it is a victory that has been well-earned. They have thoroughly outplayed Afghanistan in every regard - with the bat, with the ball and on the field. In keeping with the landmark win, another record was created with Tamim Iqbal registering his seventh ODI century - the highest for any Bangladesh player. Not to forget the contributions of Sabbir Rahman who built a solid platform with Tamim, and Mahmudullah who gave them the late surge. Afghanistan had to endure many embarrassing moments on the field, their day filled with several blunders on the field. But while their bowlers showed some fight, the batsmen were nowhere in the contest. But for a brief second-wicket stand between Nawroz Mangal and Rahmat Shah, there was no semblance of a fight. And Bangladesh were also the better side by a distance as far as fielding is concerned. They nailed a couple of direct hits that sped up the Afghanistan collapse. All in all, a clinical performance to earn a historic win.","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":33.4,"text":"Shafiul Islam to Dawlat Zadran, no run, fires it on the pads, clipped away to
