Sri Lanka will badly want to end this tour on a good note, while the hosts would not want to squander the momentum they have incurred thus far through these performances. It has been a superb day of cricket, and we hope you all thoroughly enjoyed it as well. Till the next time then, this is ESPNcricinfo signing off!\n\nFat Lady : &quot;Oh Danny Boy, The Cup, the Cup is coming...&quot;\n\n&lt;b&gt;Corey Anderson, Man of the Match&lt;/b&gt;: You are not always going to get wickets, but today it was nice.  Brendon was talking to me quite a bit and backed me up. It was nice to get through ten overs today as well. Feeling reasonably good with the bat, and I thought the way Rosco and Kane played helped make my job easier. It has been really good here in Dunedin. It has been hot so it is nice to see the crowds as well. \n\nAnderson is the Man of the Match\n\n&lt;b&gt;Lahiru Thirimanne, Sri Lanka captain&lt;/b&gt;: Our concern is our death bowling. We bowled the first 35 very good, but not so in the last 15 overs. We couldn&#39;t get any wickets and we leaked runs. We need to come out of this strong. Our fast bowlers don&#39;t have much experience, especially with Nuwan and Lasith out. Lasith should be okay for the World Cup. This is all a learning curve for the young boys. Hopefully we can get it right for the World Cup. Kumar played very well in this series, but our middle order needs to be more consistent. That is our main concern. We do have another game to make this right and get our confidence right for the World Cup\n\n&lt;b&gt;Brendon McCullum, New Zealand captain&lt;/b&gt;: It was a thorough performance today. We came in against a very good SL team. The partnerships we built on the way to 315 was very good, and the bowlers came through in the end as well. Very happy with the series win. We try to be reasonably aggressive at the start, but we do have some quality batsmen who can spend time out in the middle. We have the options and some class players to help us get the balance right. Corey I thought was really good today. Kept running in hard and taking wickets and being aggressive with the ball. Ross went very well and missed out on a big total there. You are never going to be 100% as you do crave that perfection. As long as you strive to keep getting better and have the right attitude then we can do some good things. \n\nWe will be back shortly with quotes from the &lt;b&gt;match presentation&lt;/b&gt;. \n\n&lt;b&gt;6.15pm&lt;/b&gt; New Zealand complete yet another sizable victory in Dunedin, this time sealing it by 120 runs, and win the series as they take an unassailable 4-1 lead in the series. Twin 90s from Taylor and Williamson provided the framework for the first innings, before some good, disciplined bowling ensured Sri Lanka could never run away with it. Sangakkara did his best to keep this one going, but once he perished, it was only a matter of time before New Zealand finished off the job. Anderson is the pick of the bowlers having taken figures of 4 for 52.","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":40.3,"text":"McClenaghan to Lakmal, 1 wide, 129 kph, slips in the bouncer which is well over Lakmal&#39;s head as the umpire signals to the scorer","event":"1w","commId":"12632149","commSeq":204003,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"Kumar: &quot;What is Thirumanne thinking by making Lakmal bat?
