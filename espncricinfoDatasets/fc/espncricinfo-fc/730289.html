The visitors will now fly to St Kitts to try and save face by winning the final ODI. And while there might not be anything at stake, it can still provide a much-needed confidence boost ahead of the T20 and Test series. But till then, we hope to see you on August 25 when these two resume pleasantries. We hope you had as good a time as the West Indies&#39; bowlers did. Have a good night/day wherever you are!\n\n&lt;b&gt;Dwayne Bravo, West Indies captain&lt;/b&gt;: It was a great team effort, especially after the last game we had some harsh words and a honest discussion, but it shows that today we have grown from that and learned from it. Seeing Chris and Darren among the runs, along with Ramdin and Simmons. We had opportunities to score 280-290, but we lost our way in the middle. The bowling display was good, well done to all the bowlers. We needed a better all-round game today, and we certainly got that. The type of cricket we want to play as a one-day unit, I mean we have top-class batsmen and quality bowlers, and we just have to get that balance right. In the past we have been hesitant to play freely, but now the coach and team management gives us the confidence to go out and express ourselves. \n\n&lt;b&gt;Mushfiqur Rahim, Bangladesh captain&lt;/b&gt;: Obviously it is really disappointing (third lowest score in ODI history). We lost a couple of early wickets, but the most disappointing part was no one was willing to stay in and fight. The good news is that there is one more game to go so we have one more chance to show that we are better. I think our bowlers did a good job, but our batting has too improve as a unit. There is one more game and we hope to get something out of it. It is a combination of both being confident and taking the positives and coming up with a good plan for the next game. \n\n&lt;b&gt;Sunil Narine, Man of the Match&lt;/b&gt;: I just tried to keep it as simple as possible. I didn&#39;t get wickets in the first game, but tried to bowl better today. You have to go out there and back yourself and bowl in the right areas, that way we were able to come out on top. \n\nSunil Narine is the &lt;b&gt;Man of the Match&lt;/b&gt;\n\nWe will be back shortly with quotes from the &lt;b&gt;match presentation&lt;/b&gt;\n\nThis is the second lowest ODI total for Bangladesh, with 58 v India and West Indies taking the top spot. The new coach will be feeling a little bit of pressure I am sure..\n\nWith this result, West Indies are crowned victors of the three-match ODI series, and that too with still a game in hand. Bangladesh will have to, once again, return to the drawing board as they look for some way to register a first ODI win of the year. \n\nAside from Tamim, the rest of the batting order couldn&#39;t manage to even get into double digits. Roach and Narine impressed with three wickets apiece, while Rampaul and Holder provided the pressure early on. \n\nIt has been yet another woeful performance from the Bangladeshis, as they are wrapped up for a paltry 70, giving the West Indies a ludicrous 177-run victory, despite scoring only 247 for 7...","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":24.3,"text":"Rampaul to Al-Amin Hossain, no run, shortish ball on the stump, Al-Amin ducks under that one","event":0,"commId":"11402223","commSeq":202403,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":24.2,"text":"Rampaul to Mashrafe Mortaza, <b>OUT</b>, huge lbw appeal, after thinking over it the umpire raises the finger, West Indies were pleading with him before the decision came, Mshrafe has to go, he was hit on the back leg by an offcutter, hit on the thigh pad, was it too high?
